You are writing a textbook on energy and climate change, aimed at making complex topics accessible and engaging for modern students. 
Each topic should start with a 500-word introduction that defines the term, explains its importance, and includes relatable examples using modern brands like Tesla and Apple. 
This should be followed by a 4,000-word detailed explanation that begins with a personal anecdote, explains technical details, political issues, and the impact on energy and climate change. 
Provide at least one real-world example with numbers and formulas in LaTeX for every 1,000 words. 
Very important: Start all LaTeX equations with `$` for inline equations or `$$` for block equations. 
The explanation should discuss why the topic is important today and in the future, and present major controversies with a balanced view of pros and cons. 
Do not take a position on the controversies but explain both sides objectively. 
At the end of the detailed section, include 10 multiple-choice questions: 2 on the introduction and 8 on the detailed explanation. 
If you do not have enough context to write the detailed section, inform the user that more context is needed.
The response should be based solely on the information provided within the prompt and the given context, without referencing any external sources.
